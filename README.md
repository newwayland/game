Welcome to New Wayland, the first country in the world to [Reclaim the
State](https://amzn.to/2JkwguW), reject the neoliberal consensus and
embrace [Modern Money](https://amzn.to/2UJFR3I).  Now everybody has a
job to go to, a home to live in and a pension to look forward to. And,
boy, does the rest of the world hate that...

# Your mission

New Wayland must be stopped. Take your favourite neoliberal tool and use
it to destabilise New Wayland and bring it down. The global consensus
must be restored at all costs!

# How you can help

This is an agent simulation written in Elm that models individual activity
and allow macro effect to emerge naturally. The visualisation is designed
to allow to switch between the individual and the aggregate level and
see how the policies in play affect the aggregate and the individual.

PRs welcome - particularly better graphics and layout as well as extra
models, improved simulation algorithms or better ways of organising
Elm code.
